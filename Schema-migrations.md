Whenever your schema changes you need to increment the database version number, either through `Configuration` or AA_DB_VERSION meta-data. If new classes are added, ActiveAndroid will automatically add them to the database. If you want to change something in an existing table however (e.g. add a column or rename a table), this is done using sql-scripts named `<NewVersion>.sql`, where NewVersion is the AA_DB_VERSION, in `assets/migrations`. 

ActiveAndroid will execute a script if its filename is greater than the old database-version and smaller or equal to the new version.

Letâ€™s assume you added a column `color` to the `Items` table. You now need to increase AA_DB_VERSION to 2 and provide a script `2.sql`. 

```sql
ALTER TABLE Items ADD COLUMN color INTEGER;
```

Please refer to the [SQLite docs](https://www.sqlite.org/lang_altertable.html) for more info on the `ALTER TABLE` command capabilities.
