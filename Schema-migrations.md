Whenever your schema changes you need to increment the database version number, either through `Configuration` or AA_DB_VERSION meta-data. If new classes are added, ActiveAndroid will automatically add them to the database. If you want to change something in an existing table however (e.g. add or delete a column), this is done using sql-scripts named `<NewVersion>.sql`, where NewVersion is the AA_DB_VERSION, in `assets/migrations`. 

ActiveAndroid will execute a script if its filename is greater then the old database-version and smaller or equal to the new version.

Letâ€™s assume you added a column `colour` to the `Items` table. You now need to increase AA_DB_VERSION to 2 and provide a script `2.sql`. 

```sql
ALTER TABLE Items ADD COLUMN Color INTEGER;
```
